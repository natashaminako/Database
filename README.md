# Programming and Databases Study Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing exercises and projects related to database management and programming. The purpose is to reinforce learning and provide practical experience, complementing academic work.

## Repository Structure

- **exercises/**: Contains exercises designed to practice core database concepts such as SQL queries, schema design, normalization, and optimization techniques.
- **projects/**: Includes full-fledged database projects that involve advanced concepts such as stored procedures, triggers, transactions, and performance tuning.

## Repository Rules

1. **Content**: Only database-related exercises and projects for study purposes. Personal or commercial work should not be included.
2. **Organization**: Ensure a clear and consistent directory structure for easy navigation.
3. **Code Quality**: Follow best practices in database design and SQL programming, and provide comments where appropriate.
4. **Version Control**: Use meaningful commit messages and branch off for new tasks or changes.
5. **Testing**: Ensure SQL scripts or projects can be tested easily, including mock data where necessary.
6. **Security**: Avoid storing sensitive data (such as real passwords or private keys) and make sure `.gitignore` is properly configured for unwanted files.
7. **Collaboration**: Adhere to the contribution guidelines and review others' code before merging.
8. **Documentation**: Keep the `README.md` up to date with details on database schemas, setup instructions, and useful tips.

## What is Prohibited

3. **Unrelated Changes**: Focus only on database-related exercises and projects. Unrelated content will not be accepted.
4. **Unnecessary Files**: Avoid committing database dumps, temporary files, or specific configuration files from IDEs or database management tools.
5. **Malicious or Unsafe Code**: Any code or queries that can harm the system, including those that can corrupt or damage databases, is strictly prohibited.
6. **Undocumented Changes**: Any structural or major changes to the project should be clearly explained and documented both in commit messages and in the `README.md` where relevant.
